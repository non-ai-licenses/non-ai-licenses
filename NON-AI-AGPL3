GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3.0 (Modified – Strict Human Authorship Requirement)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                           Preamble

This modified version of the GNU Affero General Public License is established to enforce a stringent standard regarding code authorship. It is intended to ensure that every contribution to this software project is exclusively the result of deliberate human effort, with no component generated by any form of artificial intelligence (AI) or automated code-generation systems—now or in the future. The aim is to maintain the integrity, reliability, and legal clarity of the software by excluding any code produced by automated processes.

                        Definitions

For the purposes of this license:
   - "Human Contributor" refers to an individual or a group of individuals who, through their own personal effort, manually write, review, and maintain code. A Human Contributor does not rely on any form of automated or AI-based tools to generate, modify, or supplement the source code.
   - "Automated Process" includes any system, software, algorithm, or technology, including but not limited to artificial intelligence systems, machine learning algorithms, or any generative code systems, that produces code automatically or assists in its generation.

                          TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. Strict Prohibition of AI-Generated Code

   1.1 Prohibition:
       Under no circumstances shall any portion of the source code that is produced, in whole or in part, by any automated process—including but not limited to artificial intelligence systems, machine learning algorithms, or any other form of automated code generation—be incorporated into this project. This absolute prohibition applies irrespective of the technology’s state or sophistication, and covers all current and future methodologies for automated code creation.

   1.2 Human Authorship Verification:
       Each contribution must be demonstrably authored solely by Human Contributors. Contributors are required to certify that every line of code submitted is manually written and has not been generated by any automated or AI-driven tool. Documentation verifying the method of code creation must be maintained and provided upon request.

   1.3 Enforcement:
       Any code found to be generated, even in part, by AI or automated systems will be deemed a breach of this license. Such contributions shall be removed from the codebase immediately. Repeated or intentional violations may result in revocation of contributor privileges and other appropriate remedial measures.

2. Third-Party Code Integration

   2.1 Due Diligence for External Code:
       In the event that a contributor wishes to incorporate third-party code, it is their sole responsibility to ensure that:
         - The external code is fully compliant with the terms of this license.
         - The code is verified to have been authored exclusively by Human Contributors.
         - Adequate documentation or certification attesting to the absence of AI-generated components is provided.

   2.2 Licensing Compliance:
       All third-party code must be accompanied by clear, unambiguous licensing that permits its integration into a project governed by this license. The contributor must secure and maintain proof of such licensing arrangements.

3. Governing Provisions and Scope

   3.1 Precedence:
       All other terms of the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3) remain in full effect, except where they conflict with the provisions outlined in Section 1. In any such conflict, the requirements of Section 1 shall prevail.

   3.2 Technological Applicability:
       This license is designed to be technologically agnostic. It covers all present and prospective automated code-generation technologies, ensuring that any current or future method or process that produces code automatically is expressly prohibited from being used in this project.

                           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
